 35  * Base class to extend to create setting controls.
 36  * &lt;p&gt;
 37  * The following example shows a naive implementation of a setting control for
 38  * regular expressions:
 39  *
 40  * {@snippet class=&quot;Snippets&quot; region=&quot;SettingControlOverview1&quot;}
 41  *
 42  * The {@code setValue(String)}, {@code getValue()} and
 43  * {@code combine(Set&lt;String&gt;)} methods are invoked when a setting value
 44  * changes, which typically happens when a recording is started or stopped. The
 45  * {@code combine(Set&lt;String&gt;)} method is invoked to resolve what value to use
 46  * when multiple recordings are running at the same time.
 47  * &lt;p&gt;
 48  * The setting control must have a default constructor that can be invoked when
 49  * the event is registered.
 50  * &lt;p&gt;
 51  * To use a setting control with an event, add a method that returns a
 52  * {@code boolean} value and takes the setting control as a parameter. Annotate
 53  * the method with the {@code @SettingDefinition} annotation. By default, the
 54  * method name is used as the setting name, but the name can be set explicitly
 55  * by using the {@code @Name} annotation. If the method returns {@code true},
 56  * the event will be committed.
 57  * &lt;p&gt;
 58  * It is recommended that the {@code setValue(String)} method updates an
 59  * efficient data structure that can be quickly checked when the event is
 60  * committed.
 61  * &lt;p&gt;
 62  * The following example shows how to create an event that uses the
 63  * regular expression filter defined above.
 64  *
 65  * {@snippet class=&quot;Snippets&quot; region=&quot;SettingControlOverview2&quot;}
 66  *
 67  * &lt;p&gt;
 68  * The following example shows how an event can be filtered by assigning the
 69  * {@code &quot;uriFilter&quot;} setting with the specified regular expressions.
 70  *
 71  * {@snippet class=&quot;Snippets&quot; region=&quot;SettingControlOverview3&quot;}

110      * The semantics of how setting values are combined depends on the setting
111      * control that is implemented, but all recordings should get at least all the
112      * events they request.
113      * &lt;p&gt;

116      * value is not valid for this setting control, the value should be ignored.
117      * &lt;p&gt;

119      * &lt;p&gt;

122      * {@code &quot;8 s&quot;}, and {@code  &quot;1 ms&quot;}, this method returns {@code &quot;1 ms&quot;}
123      * because it means that all recordings get at least all the requested data.
124      * &lt;p&gt;
125      * If the setting control represents a set of names and two recordings are
126      * running at the same time with the setting values {@code &quot;Smith, Jones&quot;} and {@code &quot;Jones,
127      * Williams&quot;} the returned value is {@code &quot;Smith, Jones, Williams&quot;} because all names would be accepted.
128      * &lt;p&gt;
129      * If the setting control represents a boolean condition and four recordings are
130      * running at the same time with the following values {@code &quot;true&quot;}, {@code &quot;false&quot;}, {@code &quot;false&quot;}, and
131      * {@code &quot;incorrect&quot;}, this method returns {@code &quot;true&quot;}, because all
132      * recordings get at least all the requested data.
133      *
134      * @param settingValues the set of values, not {@code null}
