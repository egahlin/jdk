 31  * Base class to extend to create setting controls.
 32  * &lt;p&gt;
 33  * The following example shows a naive implementation of a setting control for
 34  * regular expressions:
 35  *
 36  * {@snippet class=&quot;Snippets&quot; region=&quot;SettingControlOverview1&quot;}
 37  *
 38  * The {@code setValue(String)}, {@code getValue()} and
 39  * {@code combine(Set&lt;String&gt;)} methods are invoked when a setting value
 40  * changes, which typically happens when a recording is started or stopped. The
 41  * {@code combine(Set&lt;String&gt;)} method is invoked to resolve what value to use
 42  * when multiple recordings are running at the same time.
 43  * &lt;p&gt;
 44  * The setting control must have a default constructor that can be invoked when
 45  * the event is registered.
 46  * &lt;p&gt;
 47  * To use a setting control with an event, add a method that returns a
 48  * {@code boolean} value and takes the setting control as a parameter. Annotate
 49  * the method with the {@code @SettingDefinition} annotation. By default, the
 50  * method name is used as the setting name, but the name can be set explicitly
 51  * by using the {@code @Name} annotation. If the method returns {@code true},
 52  * the event will be committed.
 53  * &lt;p&gt;
 54  * It is recommended that the {@code setValue(String)} method updates an
 55  * efficient data structure that can be quickly checked when the event is
 56  * committed.
 57  * &lt;p&gt;
 58  * The following example shows how to create an event that uses the
 59  * regular expression filter defined above.
 60  *
 61  * {@snippet class=&quot;Snippets&quot; region=&quot;SettingControlOverview2&quot;}
 62  *
 63  * &lt;p&gt;
 64  * The following example shows how an event can be filtered by assigning the
 65  * {@code &quot;uriFilter&quot;} setting with the specified regular expressions.
 66  *
 67  * {@snippet class=&quot;Snippets&quot; region=&quot;SettingControlOverview3&quot;}
 68  *
 69  * @see SettingDefinition

 85      * &lt;p&gt;
 86      * The semantics of how setting values are combined depends on the setting
 87      * control that is implemented, but all recordings should get at least all the
 88      * events they request.
 89      * &lt;p&gt;
 90      * This method should have no side effects, because the caller might cache values.
 91      * This method should never return {@code null} or throw an exception. If a
 92      * value is not valid for this setting control, the value should be ignored.
 93      * &lt;p&gt;
 94      * Examples:
 95      * &lt;p&gt;
 96      * if the setting control represents a threshold and three recordings are
 97      * running at the same time with the setting values {@code &quot;10 ms&quot;},
 98      * {@code &quot;8 s&quot;}, and {@code  &quot;1 ms&quot;}, this method returns {@code &quot;1 ms&quot;}
 99      * because it means that all recordings get at least all the requested data.
100      * &lt;p&gt;
101      * If the setting control represents a set of names and two recordings are
102      * running at the same time with the setting values {@code &quot;Smith, Jones&quot;} and {@code &quot;Jones,
103      * Williams&quot;} the returned value is {@code &quot;Smith, Jones, Williams&quot;} because all names would be accepted.
104      * &lt;p&gt;
105      * If the setting control represents a boolean condition and four recordings are
106      * running at the same time with the following values {@code &quot;true&quot;}, {@code &quot;false&quot;}, {@code &quot;false&quot;}, and
107      * {@code &quot;incorrect&quot;}, this method returns {@code &quot;true&quot;}, because all
108      * recordings get at least all the requested data.
109      *
110      * @param settingValues the set of values, not {@code null}
111      *
112      * @return the value to use, not {@code null}
